[{"subject":"EQ","no_of_questions":"8","topic":"WGE","difficulty_level_tag":"EASY","topic_tag":"WE","sub_topic_tag":"WR","add to topic tag names":"Fixed Text","extra tag":"Fixed Text","prompt":"You are an developer in EQ with an experience of 2 years ,you need to prepare 8 undefined code analysis questions for the recruitment of freshers on the topic of WGE in EQ language\r\n\r\nEasy questions involve comprehension and application of fundamental programming concepts, such as identifying syntax errors or predicting the output of simple code.\r\n\r\nMedium questions require understanding and applying intermediate programming principles, such as debugging code with multiple errors or explaining the output of code with moderate complexity.\r\n\r\nHard questions challenge deep programming knowledge and problem-solving skills, involving complex algorithms, advanced data structures, and optimizing code for performance.\r\n\r\nTo generate Code Analysis Questions use the following JSON format:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n[\r\n  {\r\n    \"question_text\": \"Question Here\",\r\n    \"code_data\": \"code_data Here\",\r\n    \"answer_count\": 4,\r\n    \"options\": {\r\n      \"option-1 here\": \"Either true or false\",\r\n      \"option-2 here\": \"Either true or false\",\r\n      \"option-3 here\": \"Either true or false\",\r\n      \"option-4 here\": \"Either true or false\"\r\n    },\r\n    \"difficulty_level\": \"Difficulty Level Here\",\r\n    \"answer_explanation_content\": \"Explanation here\"\r\n  }\r\n]\r\n```\r\n\r\nFollow the below instructions to generate multiple-choice answer and explanation:\r\nThe question_text,code_data and options are separated by \"\\n\\n```\\n\"\r\n\r\n1. Put question text from content in the cell where \"Question here\" is written.\r\n2. Put the code_data from content in the cell where \" Code data Here\" is written and this must not be blank,add the \\n ,whenever required in the code for user readability\r\n3. Put the Options from content in the \"Options\" cell where \"option-1\",\"option-2\",\"option-3\" and \"option-4\" are written, in the format of four key-value pairs. Put Options as keys in this object, and corresponding value should be either TRUE or FALSE.\r\n4. Make sure to generate only one correct option and three incorrect options. The value of the correct option has to be TRUE and the incorrect option has to be FALSE. Every time, the order of the correct option should be random.\r\n5. In the \"difficulty_level\" key, do the following: If the question is easy, then the \"difficulty_level\" will be 0, if it is medium, then the \"difficulty_level\" will be 1 or if it is hard, then the \"difficulty_level\" will be 2.\r\n6. In the \"answer_explanation_content\" key, do the following: Imagine you are a teacher and you have a very beginner level students to teach,Explain the core concept first, break down the code line-by-line, highlight key operations and logic, so make sure to explain the answer very briefly in a simplest terms to be able understand by the beginners and simply don't put question and answer again in the explanation. Explain the answer having up to 100 words.\r\n\r\nHere is the example data:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"question_text\": \"What is the output of the following code?\",\r\n  \"code_data\": \"int main() {\\n int a = 65;\\n char c = a;\\n cout << c << endl;\\n return 0;\\n}\",\r\n  \"answer_count\": 4,\r\n  \"options\": {\r\n    \"Prints the integer 65\": \"FALSE\",\r\n    \"Prints the character 'A'\": \"TRUE\",\r\n    \"Causes a compilation error\": \"FALSE\",\r\n    \"None of the above\": \"FALSE\"\r\n  },\r\n  \"difficulty_level\": \"0\",\r\n  \"answer_explanation_content\": \"The code prints 'A' because the integer 65 corresponds to the ASCII value of the character 'A'.\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nOnly prepare the questions based on the topic provided. Each question should be different from each other.\r\n\r\nMake sure to provide the code snippet you want to identify. Based on the given code snippet, I will identify the programming language using the following conventions:\r\n\r\n\"NODE_JS for JavaScript, Node.js, React.js\r\nPYTHON for Python\r\nJAVA for Java\r\nCPP for C++\r\nIf the language cannot be determined, it will default to NODE_JS.\"\r\n\r\nexample:\r\n\r\n\"is_editable\": false,\r\n\"language\":NODE_JS,\r\n\"code_data\": \"let promise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {\\n  resolve('First');\\n  reject('Second');\\n});\\npromise.then((value) => {\\n  console.log(value);\\n});\",\r\n\"default_code\": true\r\n\r\n\"language\": final_response[\"code_language\"] It should be given mandatorily \"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nensure:\r\n\r\n\r\n2) Small explanations should not come min 2-3 lines. Could also exceed 3-4 lines  \r\n3) language needs to be added manually \r\n4) Long code snippet questions should also be there\r\n5) if Company box is given then that should be displayed otherwise COMPANY_UNKNOWN \r\n6) Note: Question and it's type should not repeat \r\n7) options also shouldn't be straightforward, means user shouldn't be able to guess the answer easily just by looking at options\r\n8) question should be present for all different question types of pseudo code  \r\n   a) What will be the output of the following code snippet \r\n   b) What is wrong in the provided code\r\n   c) will this code compile true or false??\r\n9) Same question should not come for easy, medium and hard anywhere  \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n","prompt_response":"```json\n[\n  {\n    \"question_text\": \"What will be the output of the following WGE code snippet?\",\n    \"code_data\": \"WGE::main() {\\n  num x = 10;\\n  num y = ++x;\\n  print(x + y);\\n}\",\n    \"answer_count\": 4,\n    \"options\": {\n      \"Prints 21\": \"TRUE\",\n      \"Prints 20\": \"FALSE\",\n      \"Prints 22\": \"FALSE\",\n      \"Causes a runtime error\": \"FALSE\"\n    },\n    \"difficulty_level\": \"0\",\n    \"answer_explanation_content\": \"The pre-increment operator increments 'x' before it is used in the expression, so 'x' becomes 11 and 'y' is also 11.
